Early detection of wildfires is critical for effective response and management. This is achieved through a combination of ground patrols, fire lookout towers, and advanced technologies. __Satellite imagery and remote sensing technology play a significant role in detecting hotspots and monitoring fire progression in real-time. Drones equipped with cameras and sensors can provide detailed information about a fireâ€™s location, size, and behavior, allowing for quicker and more informed decision-making__.
